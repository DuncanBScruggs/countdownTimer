# Countdown Timer

##  Description
        Create a webpage that displays a countdown, in digital clock format

        For this project we will be using the Date object and setInterval / setTimeout

 

##  MVP
        - By default, the app should display a working countdown timer.

##  Tech Stack
        - HTML
        - CSS
        - JS
# Process
##  Setup
        - Plan out and pseudocode your project
        - Create GitHub repo (either online or locally), for example: my-app
        - Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
        - Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
        - Save all and create your first commit to master, then switch to a dev branch
##  Application File Structure
        repo/
            index.html - main page
            css/ - folder to contain CSS files
                style.css - main stylesheet
            img/ - folder to contain any images
            js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
                main.js - main JavaScript file
            README.md - any important information
            .gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked

        - Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

        - It is okay if your project has more files and directories, but you at least need the ones listed above.

##  Develop
        - Create a dev branch to commit your code to
        - Add content and elements to your website
        - View changes and test locally
        - Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
        - Push your commits to GitHub remote
        - For bug fixes, refactored code, and feature branches, you must create a branch off of dev onto a new-feature branch and create a Pull Request into dev branch when complete

##  Deploy
        - Create a Pull Request from dev into master
        - Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
        - Link your username.github.io to point to your new project or add it to an existing portfolio in settings
        - Post a link to your GitHub Pages Site to the Operations Slack channel

##  Requirements
        - To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

        - Display the time in a digital clock format
        - The only time related data that should display is: (Hour:Minute:Second) (counting down to something within the same day) and (Day-Month-Year) if applicable (counting down to something in the far future)
        - Make sure it updates every second without refreshing the page
        - Stop the timer when countdown reaches 0

##  Additional Requirements
        - Website must be responsive
        - Website must be styled
        - Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the Class Resources Repo.
        - Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
        - Remember to push to GitHub!
        - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

##  Stretch Goals
        - Change the font for the display; a mono-spaced font would look more like a digital clock, and it wouldn't jar your eyes as the variable-width string is re-centered every second.
        - Accept user input for length of timer.
        - Play an audible alert when countdown reaches 0
        - Play the song!
        - Make it look like an analog countdown timer

##  If you finish early
        - Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
        - Add info to your projects README.md README.md Best Practices
        - Share links and resources from this week to the Help slack channel.
